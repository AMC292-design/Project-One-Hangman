Overview:
Browser web based wordmatch game. 

Description:
This project is a web-based browser game. Inspired by the classic game "Hangman" itself. My version utilizes 
a basic yet easy-to-use keyboard. Which was inspired by the well known functional design-QWERTY style. 
In hopes it will give users/gamers a familiarity with the placement of the letters when using the game's built-in
keyboard feature. The game has multiple attempts, with underscores indicating the amount of letters in the 
possible word. The game itself and the game design allow for a simplistic and engaging way to pass the time 
playing this classic version of a word match game.
