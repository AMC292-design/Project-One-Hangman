// Constants - information that doesn't change

const 

// Array of words: 5-7 words/hints or however many you choose

// Variables - information that changes throughout gameplay
// attempts - the number of attempts a player has to guess wrong (any number is fine)
// wordToMatch - ex: ["h", "o", "r", "s", "e"]; this contains the word we need to guess
// wordGuessed - ex: ["h", "o", "_", "_", "_"]; this contains the letters chosen by the user

// Element references
// wordToBeGuessedElement - this is where we print the letters of the word being guessed
// keyboardElement - this is a reference to the element holding all your keys buttons
// attemptsRemainingElement - this is a reference to a dom element that shows how many attempts are remaining

// Event Listeners
// keyboardElement - this element needs an event listener so we can respond each time
// a key button is clicked

// Functions

// handleClick
// This function will be called each time a key button is clicked
// check if the number attempts remaining has reach 0; if so, we need to immediately return (stop the game)
// read which key was clicked so we can make a comparison
// check if the key value they clicked is included in the wordToMatch Array
// if it's not a match, we need to decrement the attempts variable
    // update the number of attempts remaining in the dom
// if it is a match, we'll add it to the wordGuessed array
// update the wordToBeGuessed element in the dom with the correct letter the user guessed

// startGame
// resets the attempts variable to max wrong guesses
// reset the wordToMatch variable to an array of characters of the word to be guessed ex: ["h", "o", "r", "s", "e"]
// reset the wordGuessed variable to and array of underscores to represent blank spaces ex: ["_", "_", "_"]
